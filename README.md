# Minerva

[![CI](https://github.com/brandyn-s/minerva-template/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/brandyn-s/minerva-template/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](./LICENSE)

A thin runnable starter and product contract for a single-user, browser-only
**spatial creative prototype** with no sign-in. Minerva is a living atlas of
ideas: visible inheritance, three views, contextual creative moves, Weave,
Wander, Agent Drive, concurrent voice and usable outputs.

**Implemented:** the Next.js shell, original identity and CI/document checks.
**To build:** the fifteen capabilities in [SPEC](./docs/product/SPEC.md).
Keep this template content-free; implement the application in its generated
repository.

The application will ship with editable demo data for **What to do with a dead
shopping mall**, demonstrating every tool alongside fully functional capabilities
and a blank-start path. The owner judges idea feasibility and creative usefulness
while steering milestone chunks. See [the demo contract](./docs/product/SPEC.md#shipped-demo-and-human-judgment).

## Run locally

```sh
npx --yes --package=node@24.20.0 --package=npm@12.0.2 npm ci
npx --yes --package=node@24.20.0 --package=npm@12.0.2 npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Dev/start bind to loopback; the
shell needs no cloud account, provider key or sign-in. Add database, model and
voice configuration when implementing those capabilities.

The browser is the only client, not the only runtime. Keep the Next.js/TypeScript
monolith, internal server endpoints, server-held credentials, Postgres and
durable Vercel workflows. External REST/MCP APIs and accounts are excluded.
Hosting is optional only behind an existing suitable private boundary that
preserves no-sign-in use and denies outside access; otherwise stay local.

## Build and review

[Build prompts](./docs/build-prompts.md) contain 32 work packages across six
milestones, a Fable review for each milestone and an outside-consultation prompt.
Use one connected user outcome per assignment. Related packages may share a
session; a difficult package may span sessions. All capabilities remain required.

Astra in Codex builds; the operator starts Fable 5.1 in Claude on a separate
checkout of the exact candidate. Both start at medium effort. Use the existing
handoff and capability record, not extra process machinery. See
[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for working rules and [setup](./docs/setup.md) for
copyable launch instructions. Publication and hosting need separate authorization.

## Documentation

| Concern | Source |
|---|---|
| Purpose, complete experience and falsifiers | [INTENT](./docs/product/INTENT.md) |
| Required capabilities C01-C15 and acceptance scenarios | [SPEC](./docs/product/SPEC.md) |
| State ownership, boundaries and open implementation choices | [ARCHITECTURE](./docs/product/ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Living-atlas identity and interaction | [DESIGN](./docs/product/DESIGN.md) |
| Implementation evidence | [CAPABILITIES](./docs/product/CAPABILITIES.md) |
| Work packages and milestone reviews | [Build prompts](./docs/build-prompts.md) |
| Repository identity, sessions and local operation | [Setup](./docs/setup.md) |

Read the relevant source, not every document each session. SPEC owns behavior;
CAPABILITIES records evidence; the application's short `docs/HANDOFF.md` names
the current outcome and next step.

## Check and contribute

```sh
npx --yes --package=node@24.20.0 --package=npm@12.0.2 npm run check
```

`check` runs lint, typecheck, tests and build. Seed tests check document structure,
references and selected textual guards, not semantic consistency or product
behavior. Review prose against its owning contract and add behavior coverage as
capabilities arrive.
ESLint 9 matches the installed Next.js plugin peer ranges; upgrade them together
when compatible, without suppressing peer errors or removing lint rules.

Use a branch and PR; merge only after required CI. Generated repositories need
their own settings and corrected identity URLs; follow [setup](./docs/setup.md).
Report vulnerabilities privately under [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
