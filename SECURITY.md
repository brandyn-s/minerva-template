# Security policy

Minerva is pre-alpha software. It is not yet suitable for production data,
sensitive source material, or unattended use.

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| Current `main` | Yes |
| Old commits, forks, and unreleased prototypes | No |

## Report a vulnerability

Do not disclose a vulnerability in a public issue, discussion, pull request, or
commit.

Use
[GitHub's private security-advisory form](https://github.com/brandyn-s/minerva-template/security/advisories/new).
If it is unavailable, do not send vulnerability details through a public
channel; wait for the maintainer to restore private reporting or publish a
verified private contact method.

Include only what is necessary to reproduce and assess the issue:

- the affected revision and surface;
- impact and required preconditions;
- minimal reproduction steps or a proof of concept;
- whether credentials, user content, or external services are involved; and
- any known mitigation.

Reports are handled on a best-effort basis. The maintainer will validate the
finding, coordinate a fix and disclosure when appropriate, and credit reporters
who want attribution. This project does not currently operate a bug bounty.

## Security boundaries

Especially relevant reports include:

- credentials or private content reaching the browser, logs, Git, or evidence;
- AI context containing material outside the user's explicit selection;
- untrusted model output bypassing validation or durable-state boundaries;
- admission, spend, cancellation, or retry controls failing open;
- dependency, build, or GitHub Actions supply-chain compromise; and
- a simulation or partial failure being represented as live, durable, or safe.

The repository's checks reduce risk; they are not a security certification.
